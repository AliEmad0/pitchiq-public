/**
 * One avatar component for every player surface — squad grid, compare slot
 * pickers, search results, leaderboards. It owns the source-resolution chain so
 * no consumer has to know how a `photo` value maps to an image:
 *
 *   1. **Photo asset code** (numeric string, e.g. `"223340"`, written by TASK-602)
 *      → hot-link to the Premier League CDN.
 *   2. **Absolute URL** (starts with `http(s)://`, e.g. a committed portrait URL)
 *      → used as-is.
 *   3. **Anything else** — `""`, `null`, a non-numeric/non-URL string → render a
 *      deterministic initials monogram (no broken-image icon).
 *
 * For an FPL code there are TWO candidate PL CDN URLs (TASK-M28f): the **current**
 * path `…/premierleague25/photos/players/110x140/{code}.png` (the PL migrated here
 * — it resolves the codes the old path 404s, e.g. Alisson/Salah) and the **legacy**
 * `…/premierleague/photos/players/250x250/p{code}.png` as a fallback. The component
 * tries them in order; if every candidate fails to load (a genuinely-missing photo,
 * a moved Commons file) the `onError` handler swaps to the initials monogram so a
 * broken-image box is **never** shown (TASK-M28). This is why it's a client component.
 *
 * Replaces the ad-hoc `<Image src={photo}>` + initials blocks that used to live
 * in each consumer. Those broke the moment TASK-602 turned `photo` into a bare
 * FPL code (`<img src="223340">` resolves to a 404), which is what motivated
 * consolidating the logic here.
