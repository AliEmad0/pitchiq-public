 * never played the requested season returns `null` → the page 404s, which is
 * correct (you can't open Stoke's 2024-25 page — they weren't in the league).
 *
 * The snapshot `Team` carries: id, name, code (3-char), founded, venue (string,
 * not nested), capacity, logo (already `/logos/<id>.png`). The adapter
 * synthesizes the rest of the nested wire shape — `country` ← "England",
 * `national` ← false, `venue.{address,city,surface,image}` ← null. None of
 * those null fields are read by consumers (verified via grep of
 * `src/features/teams/components/`).
